# Diabetes Prediction System 🩺

This machine learning project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on their age, BMI, and heart disease history. It uses logistic regression as the prediction model and handles data imbalance with SMOTE.

## 📌 Features

- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Correlation matrix and heatmap visualization
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- SMOTE for balancing data
- Logistic Regression model
- Real-time user input prediction

## 📂 Dataset

- File: `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`
- Source: Included in the repository (or from Kaggle)
- Important features: `age`, `bmi`, `heart_disease`, `diabetes`

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
